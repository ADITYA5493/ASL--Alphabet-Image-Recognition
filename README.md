# ASL Alphabet Image Recognition

Welcome to the ASL Alphabet Image Recognition project! This repository contains code for a machine learning model that recognizes American Sign Language (ASL) alphabet signs from images.

## Introduction
This project aims to create a deep learning model capable of recognizing the 26 letters of the ASL alphabet from images. The model is trained on a dataset of hand signs and can be used to assist in educational tools, communication aids, and more.

## Features

- Image preprocessing and augmentation
- Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model for image classification
- Training and evaluation scripts
- Real-time image recognition using a webcam
- Model performance metrics and visualization


The dataset used for training and evaluation consists of images of hands signing the ASL alphabet. The dataset can be downloaded from [this link](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/grassknoted/asl-alphabet).
